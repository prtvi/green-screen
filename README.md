# Green Screen Algorithm 
The Green Screen Algorithm is the algorithm used to change the background behind an *object* with a background of our choice. This process is widely used in applications where the background needs to be changed. More about the algorithm [here](https://prithviie.github.io/html/projects/green_screen.html).


## About the Project
This a simple implementation of the Green Screen Algorithm for static images. Implementation in Python and MATLAB.


## Requirements
- An image with an object over a green background as shown below: Foreground (*fg.png*): <br>
![Foreground](./fg.png) <br>

- A background image (*bg.png*): <br>
![Background](./bg.png) <br>

- Make sure both images are of the same dimensions.


## File Description
- [green.m](https://github.com/prithviie/green-screen/blob/master/green.m): Run the Green Screen Algorithm in MATLAB.

- [green.py](https://github.com/prithviie/green-screen/blob/master/green.py): Run the Green Screen Algorithm in Python. Requirements:
  - PIL (pillow) imaging library
  - Numpy

- Images [fg.png](https://github.com/prithviie/green-screen/blob/master/fg.png) and [bg.png](https://github.com/prithviie/green-screen/blob/master/bg.png) added for testing.
